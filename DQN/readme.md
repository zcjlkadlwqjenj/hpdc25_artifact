Designing a network and corresponding loss function for the specified task involves multiple steps. Here's a breakdown of a potential approach to tackle this problem:

### 1. Understanding the Problem

- **Objective**: Maximize the value of $A^4$, where $A$ is a 16x16 binary matrix.
- **Constraint**: Each column of $A$ must contain exactly four 1s. This constraint ensures that $A$ is a constant weight matrix.

### 2. Network Design

You can use a neural network to generate the matrix $A$. Here's a possible architecture:

- **Input Layer**: Since there is no traditional "input" for this problem, the input could simply be noise or a fixed seed that allows the network to generate diverse matrices.
- **Hidden Layers**: These could be fully connected layers or convolutional layers that process the input. The choice of layers depends on the complexity needed in the model.
- **Output Layer**: The output layer should ideally produce a 256-dimensional vector (flattened 16x16 matrix) with values constrained between 0 and 1.

### 3. Imposing Binary Constraints

Since each element of $A$ needs to be binary, the output layer should apply a sigmoid function, and then a binarization step can be applied during inference or as a part of post-processing. During training, you might work directly with sigmoid outputs to maintain differentiability.

### 4. Loss Function

Designing the loss function to maximize $A^4$ while keeping the constraints is challenging. Here are the components of the loss function:

- **Column Constraint Loss**: Ensure that each column sums to 4. This can be implemented as a penalty term in the loss function:

  $$\text{Constraint Loss} = \sum_{\text{col}=1}^{16} (\text{sum}(A_{\text{:,col}}) - 4)^2$$

  This component penalizes deviations from having exactly four 1s per column.

- **Minimize number of zeros in $A^4$**: The primary goal is to minimize the number of zeros in \( A^4 \). Here's how you might construct such a loss function:
  $$\text{Maximization Loss} = \text{Sum}(1 - (A^4)) $$
  Count the number of zeros in \( A^4 \). This can be simply done by taking the sum of ones in a matrix where 0s in \( A^4 \) are replaced by 1 and 1s by 0.

### 5. Training the Model

- **Optimizer**: Use an optimizer that can handle the constraints effectively, like Adam or SGD.
- **Regularization**: Include regularization to prevent overfitting, especially since the model has to learn a very specific structure of outputs.

### 6. Evaluation and Adjustments

- Evaluate the performance of the network by monitoring both components of the loss function.
- Adjust the weighting between the constraint loss and the maximization loss as needed to ensure that both objectives are being met.

### Implementation Notes

Implementing this model would typically involve using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The constraint that each column sums to 4 while being binary is a particularly challenging aspect and may require innovative approaches in how the loss function and the final activation are designed.

This setup could potentially lead to a complex optimization landscape, so monitoring and potentially incorporating techniques like learning rate schedules or advanced regularization might be necessary.
